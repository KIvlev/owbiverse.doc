# Objects
The universe is assembled from different components. They are listed below.

## Resources

Most creational actions require the expenditure of resources.

- Energy is the **source of everything** in the universe. It is limited, but its cache is very large.
- Space and hydrogen are **primary resources**. The energy is converted directly into these.
- Helium and metals are **complementary resources**. They are harvested when stars complete their cycle of existence.

### Space

**Space** is required to place everything you add into the universe. To create more space light up new stars!

### Hydrogen

**Hydrogen** is used to create clouds and stars. Clouds convert energy into hydrogen. Stars convert energy into space and are required for the emergence of planets. Both of these object types are also used in creation of advanced structures.

### Helium

Hydrogen that burns inside stars mostly turns into **helium**. It is not very useful, but you can't get rid of it. Helium is automatically spent in line of hydrogen if possible. This helps to conserve more valuable resource.

### Metals

**Metals** are heavier elements that “contaminate” your hydrogen and helium storage. And usually this is a good thing, because a greater “metallicity”, meaning proportion of metals to hydrogen and helim, increases the chance for emergence of planets around new stars.  
Metals appear when stars burn out, especially larger ones. But the general metallicity may shrink down, when the universe is filled by new objects made from pure hydrogen and helium, such as stars and clouds.

## Clouds

Clouds are required to convert energy into hydrogen that is used to create the universe. From smaller basic clouds it is possible to construct more complex cloud structures.

### Nebula

The simplest of clouds. Provides hydrogen and is used as a component for other cloud structures.

- 1 hydrogen.
- 10 space.
- Lasts for 1е7 years.

### Globula

Provides hydrogen at a slower rate than nebulae of the same mass, but persists for longer and is more economical in taking space. Used in creation of larger clouds.

- 1 nebula.
- 10 hydrogen.
- 10 space.
- Lasts for 3е7 years.

### Star Nursery

Spends a fraction of produced hydrogen to automatic creation of stars.

- 1 globula.
- 200 hydrogen.
- 300 space.
- Lasts for 3е7 years.

### Molecular Cloud

Large and long-lasting hydrogen generator.

- 1 globula.

- 4 000 space.
- Lasts for 3е8 years.

### Active Star Nursery

Very large automatic hydrogen and stars generator.

- 1 molecular cloud.
- 2e5 hydrogen.
- 2e5 space.
- Lasts for 1е8 years.

## Dwarf Stars

**Dwarf stars** are cheap, they last for a long time and produce space efficiently. They can have **planets** that sometimes may harbor life at some point. The larger the dwarf star is, the greater is the chance of planets forming around it, including potentially habitable ones. But larger stars burn out faster than small ones.

### Brown Dwarf

Rejects that happen during the star creation process. They just appear as subproducts of your activities and don’t matter much. They don’t even take space, contrary to all the other stars. You can’t create them manually, and you don’t need to.

### Red Dwarf

It is cost-effective in space creation, but works very slowly. The cheapest full-fledged star and the most numerous one.

- 1 hydrogen.
- 1 space.
- Lasts for 4e10 years.

### Orange Dwarf

Perfect for the development of life. Does not burns as long as the red dwarf, but has a greater chance of habitable planets formation. Life there has plenty of time to advance.

- 8 hydrogen.
- 1 space.
- Lasts for 2e10 years.

### Yellow Dwarf

Good for the emergence of life. Has an increased chance of habitable planets formation compared to the orange dwarf. Burns long enough to provide life with good chances of advance to the civilization stage.

- 10 hydrogen.
- 1 space.
- Lasts for 1e10 years.

### White-Yellow Dwarf

Has the largest habitable zone with the greatest potential for life emergence. But because of a high mass and temperature it burns out rapidly. Life rarely has enough time to advance into the space age to escape.

- 16 hydrogen.
- 1 space.
- Lasts for 2e9 years.

## Giant Stars

**Giant stars** are expensive, burn rapidly and produce a lot of space. At the end of their existence they collapse and explode. The explosion blast can damage planets at nearby stars, but it creates metals. The majority of giant stars explode as **supernovae** with neutron stars as remains. But sometimes vastly more destructive **gamma-ray bursts** happen, and as a result of these stellar matter turns into a black hole right away.

### Red Giant

A star that has consumed the majority of its fuel. It degenerates quite rapidly. You can’t create these manually, they emerge themselves from all the stars that are larger than red dwarfs.

### Yellow Giant

The most modest of giant stars. The explosion at the end of existence is not as destructive as with most others, and the probability of a gamma-ray burst is very low.

- 50 hydrogen.
- 1 space.
- Lasts for 5e8 years.

### Blue Giant

Common giant star. The destructive explosion at the end of its brief existence creates a lot of space.

- 100 hydrogen.
- 1 space.
- Lasts for 1e8 years.

### Supergiant

Huge giant star. Burns fast, its final explosion is very powerful and creates a lot of space. Greater chance of a gamma-ray burst.

- 300 hydrogen.
- 1 space.
- Lasts for 1e7 years.

### Hypergiant

Extremely giant star. Always collapses into a black hole, creating a colossal amount of space. Maximum chance of a gamma-ray burst.

- 1 000 hydrogen.
- 1 space.
- Lasts for 1e6 years.

## Degenerate Objects

**Burned stars** that have exhausted their fusion fuel. They occupy space and do not produce anything, but can be used in forming structures.

### White Dwarf

The remains of a dwarf star.

### Neutron Star

Exceptionally compact remains of a giant star.

### Magnetar

The most dense object that is not a black hole.

### Black Hole

The remains of a giant star that experienced a destructive collapse. They can be merged into supermassive black holes.

### Supermassive Black Hole

The result of the multitudes of stellar mass black holes merged into one. They are necessary for galactic formation. Contrary to smaller black holes they grow in time, consuming other stars, but do so very slowly.

## Star Clusters

**Star clusters** are the most modest of available structures. As a matter of fact these are just a lot of stars which are co-located closer to each other than usual, and therefore they are gravitationally bound. But even such simple lumps already bring noticeable variety into the homogenous landscape of the universe.

## Elliptical Galaxies

**Elliptical galaxies** resemble colossal star clusters. They have lenticular shapes, rotate slowly and look very much alike to each other. Star formation is almost completely absent there, so if no life emerged in such a galaxy during the first couple of billion years, then it probably won’t emerge later.

Civilizations develop faster in smaller galaxies, but they earlier grow into a cap which they can't overcome. For the emergence of a supercivilization on a universe scale a greater galaxy is neccessary.

## Spiral Galaxies

**Spiral galaxies** spin faster than elliptical ones. They have anisotropic structure with arms and keep active star formation. After a while spiral galaxies exhaust their stockpile of gas, slow down and revert into more stable and boring elliptical ones.

In spiral galaxies civilizations advance much faster than in elliptical ones. Smaller galaxies are still not adequate to harbor a potential universe scale supercivilization.

## Large Structures

**Large structures** are called that for a reason: whole galaxies are used there as building blocks. They are needed to arrange the universe on the largest scales. Without them the space, uniformly filled by stars and galaxies, becomes too monotonous and sparse, meanwile these structures create a packing gradient with more and less dense regions. This arrangement is better fit for being claimed and developed by superadvanced sapient beings.

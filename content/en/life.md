# Planets and Life

A lifeless universe is not that amusing as a living one. It is especially cute when its denizens try to seek truth, stay on the top of the world affairs and think high and mighty of themselves in general. However, in certain sense this is actually their own universe.

## Planets

**Planets** emerge around dwarf stars when metals are sufficient. In a sense all this space construction is being made with a purpose of making planets with potential of bearing life.

### Gas Giant

Large planet with a very thick atmosphere, unsuitable for life.

### Asteroid Belt

A bunch of rocks that lack a mass to form a planet.

### Rocky Planet

A planet unsuitable for life. Too cold, too hot or wrong chemical makeup.

### Habitable Planet

There is liquid water here and life may emerge in the long run.

### Living Planet

Denizens of this planet show great promise!

## Eons

Life advances from simpler to complex forms. The successful biological evolution is completed when the true sapience appears. Because soon after that the sapience takes matter into its own hands.

### Archean

It is difficult to notice, but these planets are full of archaea and cyanobacteria.

### Proterozoic

Alongside ubiquitous amoeba these planets host algae, sponges and even molluscs.

### Paleozoic

Ferns, worms, trilobites and fishes.

### Mezozoic

Conifers, lizards, dinosaurs and therapsids.

### Cenozoic

Flowering plants and various mammals, some of which show signs of sapience.

## Civilizations

Civilizations belong to different **types**, from 0 to 4. Inside types there is decimal divisions into **levels**, for example from 0.1 to 0.9 with the next step to 1.0. Level always is shown alongside its type, for example 1.2.

Everything is included into the level, starting from adoption of technologies and finishing with exploited space. Difference in one level means that the more advanced civilization has about **tenfold** advantage over a less developed one.

## Ethics

Each civilization has one of the six dominant **ethics**, which sum up different cultural values of a society. Depending on the ethic, the civilization is more or less successful in various processes, such as the progress, stability, expansion or warfare. Civilizations with different ethics make input into dissimilar trends.

There are no absolutely “good” or “bad” ethics. But you may prefer ones and find others less pleasant. What to do if these “others” will become too successful in your mutual universe is for you to decide.

### Mysticism

**Mystics** deeply believe in supernatural. They think that their lives are governed by a higher power. With regard to the circumstances, they are not really wrong about that.

Cultures of the mystics are based on ancient traditions. Their conservative leanings keeps society stable, but cramp the adoption of the new ideas and technologies. Don't assume that mystic societies are completely backward. Only relatively so.

Mystics aim the significant part of their efforts to the admiration of a higher power. This increases the efficiency of the primary resources generators, such as clouds and stars.

### Logic

**Logics** aspire to understand the world from the scientific point of view. They defy obscurant ideas of their backward kinsmen and do not require the hypothesis of supernatural forces to function normally.

Critical thinking of logics somewhat shackles your capabilities. It decreases the the efficiency of the primary resources generators, such as clouds and stars.

Primary pursuit of the logics is the progress. All else being equal they advance faster than any other culture. Unfortunately because of their inclination to risky experiments their societies are not that stable as they would like to think.

### Bellicosity

**Warriors** perceive the universe with cold grim determination. They do not trust aliens and do not wish to wait for them to be first to strike, thinking of the inevitable conflict in the terms of “when”, not ”if”.

Not always warriors are going for the total destruction of alien life forms. Often they are content with being the most powerful, feeling safe enough. Unfortunately, things happen.

The main purpose of existence for warriors is the war. They highly doubt the efficiency of diplomatic measures.

### Friendliness

**Friends** hope to live in peace and harmony with all their space neighbors. They make diplomatic contacts, constantly try to create stellar leagues, communities and organizations, based on principles of mutual trust and respect.

They use military actions only when all the other possibilities have been tried and did not provided adequate results, and also when it is no longer possible to sit it out.

While they are open to everything new, their attention is focused away from the most practical aspects of reality. This slows progress somewhat.

### Expansion

**Settlers** take colossal size of unclaimed cosmic expanse as a challenge. They are annoyed by empty territories without management, this is why they always try to make claims whenever it is possible.

Liberty-loving societies of settlers are not very stable. Citizens have this habit to solve any conflicts and problems by emigration. In these circumstances it is difficult to make long lasting plans.

Settlers themselves are pretty peaceful. But their approach on taking everything that seems not to be nailed down often provokes neighbors to rash measures, followed by escalation.

### Construction

**Builders** dig not wide but deep. They are accustomed to make the most of what they have, and only then to go to the next source. Civilizations of builders are spread on relatively modest territory, but compared to their high cities everything else looks like backward villages.

Culture of the builders does not allows for senseless squander, but they are not ascetic by any means. On the contrary, because of the extremely well-oiled economy, societies of the builders are extremely stable and quite pleasant to live in.

Emigration, leaving home in search for the better chance in the unknown, seems like a wasteful and foreign concept for the builders.
